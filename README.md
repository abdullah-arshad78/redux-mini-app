# Redux mini app


## This Project was created to practice my redux skills

In this project I used redux toolkit and react-redux tools to create a small app with e-commerce functionings:

- Selecting Products and choosing the quantity of products you want to add.
- Adding products in the cart as well as to the database.

- Fetching products from the database when the app loads.

-The fetching and getting the data from database was handled by custom made action creators.
